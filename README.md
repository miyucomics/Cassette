# Cassette-Sorting-Game
This is our submission for the Brooklyn Technical High School Code Overflow hackathon. It is a pretty simple game where you sort cassettes in space, given a set of rules on where they go.

## Running
This project uses the Love2D game framework. To use it, simply install Love2D and run the `love .` command in the project's directory.
